# Designing Object-Oriented Software

Just maintaining a summary + important stuff of the "Book Designing Object-Oriented Software" by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock

## 1. Why use object oriented design?
### What is software crisis?
Software is asked to perform demanding tasks these days. To perform these tasks well,
system must be understood and modeled. Software nowadays are too complicated single person to
understand. It's too easy to introduce new bugs as a result of a addition to the software or
by another bug fix. Therefor programmers proceed in tiny increments.

### How can abstraction help?
World is complex. How do we understand the world to model it in softwares? Model must be 
simpler than the system. For example, map is a model of the territory. Map has less details,
much simpler than the territory itself. Otherwise it defeat the purpose of the  model.

Map only includes carefully selected information, so the model abstract out those features from
a system that needs to be understood. Irrelevant features are ignored. Abstraction is crucial
to understand the world. 

Programmers used to feed binary instructions to computers. Those instructions are abstracted
in assembly. Common set of actions, for example adding two numbers which requires multiple assembly
instructions are further abstracted in high-level languages. Same goes with the abstracted 
data types in high-level languages. We don't have to worry about the representation at lower levels of the data
and focus on what that data do instead.

### What are Objects?
**From the book**
> The object-oriented approach attempts to manage the complexity inherent in real-world problems by abstracting out knowledge, and encapsulating it within objects. Finding or creating these objects is a problem of structuring knowledge and activities.
